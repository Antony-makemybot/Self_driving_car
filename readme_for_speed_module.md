Great question — and you're thinking in the right direction.

You're absolutely right to be suspicious about whether the sensor is fast enough to detect all pulses when the motor spins at high RPM. Let’s break it down clearly:

✅ YES, the sensor can detect fast rotations — BUT...
🔍 It depends on how you're reading it in code.
Your IR speed sensor (with the slotted disk) is capable of detecting pulses at high speed, but if you're using digitalRead() inside loop() (polling), it's very likely to miss many — or all — pulses, especially if the motor is spinning fast.

At 1000+ RPM, each slot might pass in <1 ms, and if your loop or Serial.print() takes longer than that, you’ll miss the pulse entirely.

🧪 Quick Math Example
Say your motor spins at 3000 RPM
That’s 50 rotations per second
If your slotted disk has 20 slots, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
50 rotations/sec × 20 slots = 1000 pulses/sec
= 1 pulse every 1 ms
Your Arduino’s loop() and Serial.print() are too slow to reliably catch that unless you use interrupts.

✅ Solution: Use Hardware Interrupts
Here’s a reliable interrupt-based version:

🔧 Wiring
Sensor OUT → Arduino digital pin with interrupt (e.g., D2 or D3 on Uno)

VCC → 5V

GND → GND

✅ Arduino Code (Interrupt + RPM)
cpp
Copy
Edit
volatile unsigned long pulseCount = 0;
unsigned long lastTime = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), countPulse, RISING);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  lastTime = millis();
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long currentTime = millis();
  if (currentTime - lastTime >= 1000) {
    // RPM = (pulses / slots per rev) * 60
    unsigned long pulses = pulseCount;
    pulseCount = 0;

    int slots = 20;  // adjust to your disk
    float rpm = (pulses / (float)slots) * 60.0;

    Serial.print("RPM: ");
    Serial.println(rpm);
    lastTime = currentTime;
  }
}

void countPulse() {
  pulseCount++;
}
✅ Tips to Make It Work
Use interrupt-capable pins only (D2 or D3 on Uno).

Keep countPulse() very short — just pulseCount++

Avoid using delay() or Serial.print() inside the interrupt.

Don’t use digitalRead() in loop() to measure pulse counts.

Use a stable power supply (sensor may behave erratically on low voltage).

🔍 Additional Tip: Slow Down the Motor for Testing
To confirm everything works:

Temporarily limit the motor speed using PWM:

cpp
Copy
Edit
analogWrite(motorEnablePin, 100); // range 0–255
This makes it easier to test pulse counting and see readable RPM in Serial Monitor.

🔚 Summary
Yes, the sensor is fast enough — but your code might not be.

Use interrupts to catch high-speed pulses reliably.

Don’t poll in loop() — it’s too slow.

You’re on the right track by thinking about motor speed and pulse frequency.
