âœ… Current Setup Summary
You're already doing great:

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4 + Uno + L298 + 4 DC motors + Pi Camera 2

Working: Motor control via Python on UNO, black road/white boundary vision working with OpenCV

OS: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite, accessed via SSH

Goal: Self-driving behavior with traffic sign/signal recognition, obstacle avoidance, ML/AI support

ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Improve Line Following (Classical Approach)
You're using OpenCV to detect the black surfaceâ€”nice! Before jumping into ML, you can improve this using classical CV techniques:

âœ… Tasks:
Region of Interest (ROI): Only analyze the lower portion of the camera feed.

Canny Edge Detection for better line detection.

Hough Transform (optional): To detect road lane lines.

PID Controller: For smooth turns instead of hard-coded "left/right".

ðŸ’¡ Once this is stable, you can move to ML-based perception.

ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Traffic Sign & Signal Detection (Using Machine Learning)
ðŸ”§ Hardware-Optimized Vision:
Use TensorFlow Lite or OpenCV + pretrained models for real-time inference.

ðŸ§  Choose a Model:
TinyYOLOv4 or YOLOv5 Nano: Lightweight object detectors for real-time performance.

MobileNet + SSD (from TensorFlow Lite): Easier to run on Raspberry Pi.

ðŸ“¦ Dataset:
You donâ€™t need to start from scratch.

Use GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) for traffic sign training.

For traffic lights, you can collect your own dataset (since public datasets are limited) or fine-tune YOLO with custom-labeled data using Roboflow.

ðŸ”¨ Tools:
LabelImg or Roboflow for annotation.

Train model on a PC or cloud (Google Colab), export to TFLite or ONNX.

Run inference on Pi using:

tflite_runtime

opencv.dnn module

or ultralytics package (YOLOv5/8)

ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Obstacle Detection and Avoidance
Options:
Ultrasonic/IR Sensors: Simple distance-based avoidance.

Depth Camera (e.g., OAK-D, Intel RealSense) (Optional, costly).

Vision-based detection (Advanced):

Use the same object detection model to identify obstacles (e.g., person, box).

Avoid if bounding box is within danger zone (close in frame).

ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: Decision Making (Finite State Machine â†’ Reinforcement Learning)
Start Simple:
Use a Finite State Machine (FSM):

Edit
States: FOLLOW_LANE, STOP, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, AVOID_OBSTACLE
Transitions: Based on vision input (signs, road edges, etc.)
Later (Optional):
Use Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Behavior Cloning via imitation learning.

ðŸ“Œ Phase 5: System Architecture
Here's a suggested flow:

[Pi Camera] â†’ [OpenCV Preprocessing] â†’ [ML Inference (YOLO/TFLite)] â†’ [State Decision] â†’ [UNO: Movement Commands]
Use I2C or Serial (UART) to send commands from Raspberry Pi to Arduino UNO.

ðŸ“¦ Suggested Packages
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy
pip install tensorflow tflite-runtime imutils ultralytics
If you want to test YOLOv5:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install yolov5  # or use ultralytics repo
ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
Unit Test each module (sign detection, motor commands, line follower).

Simulation Environment: You can test your ML model on PC images/videos before running it on the car.

Use matplotlib or cv2.imshow() to debug inference locally (or save images if running headless).

ðŸ’¡ Final Suggestions
âœ… Start with rule-based + CV approach for line following & traffic signals.

ðŸ“¸ Collect your own dataset with the Pi Camera to fine-tune recognition later.

ðŸ§  Keep ML models small and quantized for Raspberry Pi 4.

ðŸª› Use Roboflow to organize training and export ready-to-use models for the Pi.

Tuning the PID Controller
The PID constants:

cpp
Copy
Edit
float Kp = 0.5, Ki = 0.05, Kd = 0.1;
can be tuned to match your motor speed and turning response. General tips:

Increase Kp to make corrections more aggressive

Use Ki to eliminate small steady drift

Use Kd to dampen overshooting
