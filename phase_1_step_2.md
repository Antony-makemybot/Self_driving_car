🗺️ Phase 1 Goal: Basic Road Following
🎯 Objective
Use OpenCV on Raspberry Pi to:

Detect the white center line and left border line on a black chart

Keep the car centered between the left and center line

Move forward until the end of the chart

🛣️ Road Design (Your Description)
Element	Color	Description
Background	Black	Main road chart
Left border	White	Continuous white strip on left edge
Center line	White	Continuous white strip (1 cm) in center
Right border	White	Continuous white strip on right edge
Total lanes	2	A two-way road, but center line is continuous, not dashed

📌 For this phase, the car is only navigating between left border and center line.

🧠 Phase 1 Control Logic
Input	From	Action
Camera frame	Pi Camera	Detect white lines
Center offset	OpenCV	Calculate shift from target center
Command	Pi → Nano	Send F, T-xx, Txx, S
Gyro / Encoder	Nano → Pi	Feedback to adjust turn precisely

🧮 OpenCV Line Following Strategy
👁️ Vision Algorithm Plan
Capture frame from camera (top-down view recommended)

Convert to grayscale

Apply thresholding to highlight white lines on black background

Crop lower region of interest (ROI) (bottom of image = closer to car)

Find contours or white pixels in ROI

Detect line positions (center line and left line)

Calculate midpoint between left line and center line

Compare midpoint to image center → turn left/right/forward

🧪 Basic Vision Tuning Values
python
Copy
Edit
# Pseudocode constants
WHITE_THRESHOLD = 200  # for binary thresholding
ROI_Y = 100            # how many pixels from bottom to use as ROI
CENTER_OFFSET_TOLERANCE = 10  # pixels
🧠 Control Output Plan (sent to Nano)
Offset from center	Action
< –10 pixels	Send T-20 (turn left)
> +10 pixels	Send T20 (turn right)
Between ±10 pixels	Send F (go forward)

✅ Step-by-Step Execution Plan
✅ 1. Line Following
 Write Python OpenCV script

 Calibrate thresholds to detect white on black

 Extract left & center lines

 Compute midpoint between those two

 Compare midpoint to image center

 Send turn/forward commands to Nano

✅ 2. Command Handling
 Nano receives commands like F, T-20, T20

 Nano uses MPU6050 to track turning angle

 Nano moves car accordingly

🧠 How It Works
ROI: It takes a slice from the bottom of the image to analyze.

Thresholding: Converts the image to black and white to detect white lines.

Logic:

Detects left and center white lines.

Calculates their midpoint.

Compares that midpoint to the actual image center.

Sends turn/forward/stop commands to Nano.

✅ What You Need on the Nano Side
Ensure your Nano reads single-line commands like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
// Arduino/Nano snippet
String input = "";

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    input = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
    input.trim();

    if (input == "F") moveForward();
    else if (input == "S") stopMotors();
    else if (input.startsWith("T")) {
      int angle = input.substring(1).toInt();
      turnByAngle(angle); // Your gyro logic
    }
  }
}











Using the full resolution of the Pi Camera is absolutely fine — and in many cases, it's actually beneficial for better line detection. But it does come with some trade-offs you should be aware of:

✅ Benefits of Using Full Resolution
Benefit	Description
🔍 Better detail	You’ll see more of the road and better define lines (important for thin 1 cm lines)
📏 Wider field of view	You get more of the road layout — center and side lines clearly
🎯 Improved detection accuracy	Especially useful in low-light or if the line edges aren't sharp

⚠️ Trade-Offs and Things to Handle
Issue	Why It Happens	Solution
⚡ Slower processing	Larger images take more CPU/RAM	Use Region of Interest (ROI) smartly — don’t process the full frame every time
💾 More memory use	Especially if running YOLO later	Optimize with cv2.resize() just for detection, not display
🔄 Serial lag	If you process full-res frame every frame	Use frame skipping or throttling logic (every 2nd or 3rd frame)

🔧 Recommended Setup for Full-Resolution Usage
Capture full resolution, but only analyze a strip (ROI) near the bottom.

Don't shrink the frame, unless performance drops.

Process only 1 or 2 ROIs for fast detection and angle calculation.

✅ Example: Updated OpenCV Snippet for Full-Resolution
python
Copy
Edit
# Use full Pi camera resolution
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)

# Then use only a slice (bottom 100px) for processing
roi = binary[-100:, :]  # bottom 100 rows of full-width frame
🧠 Bonus Tips
💡 Try drawing the camera frame live with cv2.imshow("Full View", frame) to help calibrate.

🧪 You can dynamically test how much of the image to keep as ROI.

⛽ Don’t send commands every frame — only if the direction changes (saves serial bandwidth).
