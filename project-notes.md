## üîÑ Communication Protocol

Raspberry Pi communicates with Nano via USB serial (`/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).

### Serial Commands Format (Sent from Pi to Nano)

| Command     | Action                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `F`         | Move forward                   |
| `B`         | Move backward                  |
| `S`         | Stop movement                  |
| `T30`       | Turn right 30 degrees          |
| `T-45`      | Turn left 45 degrees           |
| `G`         | Request RPM data               |

### Response from Nano

Nano responds with messages like:
L:125.6,R:129.3

## ‚öôÔ∏è Encoders (IR Slot Sensors)

- Use **interrupts on D2 (INT0)** and **D3 (INT1)** on Nano.
- Recommended edge: `RISING` or `FALLING` (not `CHANGE`)
- RPM Calculation:
  ```cpp
  RPM = (ticks / pulsesPerRevolution) * 60;
Use slotted disk with known number of holes (e.g., 20 pulses/rev).

üß≠ MPU6050 Integration
Use only raw gyro data, not DMP mode (too heavy for Nano)

Read using:

cpp
Copy
Edit
mpu.getRotation(&gx, &gy, &gz);
float zRate = gz / 131.0; // degrees/second
Sample every 20‚Äì40ms

Use gyroZ to perform smooth angle-based turns:

Read initial gyroZ

Rotate until estimated delta angle = target

üß© Smart Turning Logic
Nano should not assume ‚Äúleft‚Äù = 90¬∞

Raspberry Pi decides how much to turn (e.g., 25¬∞, 60¬∞, etc.)

Pi sends command like: T-30 (turn left 30¬∞)

Nano executes turn using gyro feedback

‚úÖ Nano Design Philosophy
Task	Status / Recommendation
Motor PWM	‚úÖ Use analogWrite()
Encoder reading	‚úÖ Use attachInterrupt()
MPU6050 integration	‚úÖ Use raw gyro only
Float math	‚ö†Ô∏è Limit usage, avoid complex ops
Serial parsing	‚úÖ Use lightweight string/char logic
DMP / Quaternion	‚ùå Avoid ‚Äî not Nano-friendly

üîß Future Improvements
Add encoder-based PID control

Use encoder + gyro for simple odometry

Improve turn accuracy with angle smoothing

Add battery level sensing

Use CRC/checksum for robust command transfer

Visualize path planning via Pi web interface

üß† Raspberry Pi Multitasking and Integration
The Raspberry Pi runs several demanding tasks simultaneously:

YOLOv5-based obstacle detection (heavy computation)

Real-time camera feed with OpenCV

Serial communication with Arduino Nano

Calculations for decision-making (turn angles, speeds)

Can the Pi handle this?
Yes, but careful programming is essential to avoid blocking and lag:

Use multithreading or asynchronous programming to separate tasks.

Avoid blocking calls like waiting on serial or camera frame reads.

Consider running vision in a dedicated thread or process.

Share data between threads using thread-safe variables or locks.

If YOLOv5 slows down the loop, use a lighter model or lower frame rate.

Example Python Script Structure
A typical approach is to run separate threads for:

Serial communication with the Nano (reading sensor data, sending commands)

Camera capture and YOLO detection

Control logic that decides car movement based on sensor and vision data

# üõ£Ô∏è Phase 1 ‚Äì Line Following with OpenCV and Raspberry Pi

This document outlines the setup and logic for the **first phase** of the self-driving car project: using **OpenCV** on the **Raspberry Pi** to follow a white-lined black-chart road and send control commands to an **Arduino Nano**.

---

## üéØ Objective

Enable the car to:
- Detect and follow the **white center and left lane lines**
- Stay centered between them
- Move forward continuously using only **Pi Camera + OpenCV**
- Send commands to Nano for movement: `F`, `T-XX`, `TXX`, `S`

---

## üì∑ Camera Setup

- **Camera**: Pi Camera 2
- **Resolution**: Full (640√ó480 or higher depending on your Pi)
- **View**: Mounted slightly above, angled toward the road
- **Frame Rate**: 15‚Äì30 FPS (depending on processing load)

---

## üß± Road Structure

| Part         | Color | Description                         |
|--------------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| Background   | Black | Main chart base                     |
| Left Line    | White | Continuous white strip on far left  |
| Center Line  | White | Continuous white strip in middle    |
| Right Line   | White | Continuous white strip on far right |
| Lane Width   | ~car width + margins |
| Line Width   | ~1 cm (white paper strip)

---

## üìê Region of Interest (ROI) Cropping

To improve performance, only the **bottom portion** of the frame is analyzed, where lines are closest to the robot.

```python
roi = frame[-100:, :]  # Crops bottom 100 pixels across full width
Benefit	Description
‚ö° Faster	Smaller area to process
üéØ Focused view	Detects only where robot can see road
üß† Easier logic	Less visual noise from sky/walls

Debug Tip
To see the ROI:

python
Copy
Edit
cv2.imshow("ROI", roi)
Or draw rectangle on full image:

python
Copy
Edit
cv2.rectangle(frame, (0, 380), (640, 480), (0, 255, 0), 2)
üîç OpenCV Line Detection Logic
Convert camera frame to grayscale.

Apply binary thresholding (to isolate white lines).

Crop Region of Interest (bottom 100px).

Scan columns to detect:

First line from left = left lane

First line after center = center line

Calculate midpoint between left and center line.

Compare midpoint to image center (320px if width = 640).

Send movement command:

Offset	Command
‚âà 0 (¬±15px)	F (forward)
< ‚Äì15px	T-20 (left turn)
> +15px	T20 (right turn)
No lines found	S (stop)

üß† Raspberry Pi Responsibilities (Phase 1)
Task	Description
Capture Camera	Use OpenCV for video frames
Process ROI	Apply thresholding, detect lines
Calculate Offset	Midpoint between left + center vs image center
Send Command	Use serial to send F, T-xx, Txx, S

üß∞ Arduino Nano Responsibilities (Phase 1)
Task	Description
Receive Serial	Parses F, T-30, T30, S
Execute PWM	Controls motors via L298N
Handle Turning	Uses MPU6050 gyro to rotate by angle
Feedback (future)	Can send IMU or encoder data back to Pi

üîÅ Command Protocol (Pi ‚Üí Nano)
Command	Meaning
F	Move forward
S	Stop
T30	Turn right 30¬∞
T-45	Turn left 45¬∞

Example:
python
Copy
Edit
nano.write(b'T-20\n')
üß† Notes on Full Resolution Use
Use full camera resolution to clearly detect 1‚ÄØcm lines.

Avoid cv2.resize() unless performance suffers.

Only process ROI (don‚Äôt analyze full image each frame).

Use hardware acceleration (e.g. cv2.CAP_V4L2) if needed.

üß© Next Steps After Phase 1
‚úÖ Add feedback from Nano: gyro + encoder RPM

‚úÖ Improve turn smoothness using sensor feedback

üîú Implement obstacle detection (YOLOv5 or similar)

üîú Use full road boundaries (center + right)

üîú Add lane-change logic
